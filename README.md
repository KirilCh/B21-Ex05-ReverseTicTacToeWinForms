# B21-Ex05-ReverseTicTacToeWinForms

Final assignment of Object Oriented Programming .NET and C# course, Holon Institute of Technology, 2021.

This project consists of 2 parts:
1. First part is the GameLogic part, which was actually the 2nd assignment of this course.
2. Second part is WindowsUI - WinForms user interface

The main idea was to use previously written code (GameLogic) and integrate it with WinForms UI.

Game idea
The main idea is just like a regular tic tac toe, except here, you would want your opponent to make a streak. Whoever makes a streak - loses!

The game supports a board of 3x3 up to 9x9 (Board must be of square type). 
Possible game modes are player vs player, and player vs computer.
